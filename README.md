####You have 5 chances to guess the right number.  How close you are to the correct answer is determined on a scale of spicy peppers:
* Ghost pepper - very, very, very close!
* Habanero pepper - very hot but not as hot as a ghost pepper
* Jalapeno pepper - Hot, might want to +10 on your most recent guess
* Pepperonicini - Warm, just a tiny kick
* Green bell pepper - Way out of bounds, frigid like a refrigerated green bell pepper
